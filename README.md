Simple light theme
==================

Inspired by [vscode-ideal-theme](https://github.com/karsany/vscode-ideal-theme)

Goal
----

Don't expect any fancy colors.

More colors equals more distraction, we don't want to waste cognitive capacity
on that. The goal of this theme is to have the minimum meaningful  colors.
