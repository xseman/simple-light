# Simple Light Theme

Inspired by [IDEA like light Theme][inspired-by] and [GitLab's][gitlab-theme]
light highlighting syntax.

## Goal

Don't expect any fancy colors.

More colors equal more distraction; we don't want to waste cognitive capacity
on that. The goal of this theme is to have the minimum meaningful colors.

## Supported Languages

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Java
- Go
- C++
- Bash
- Markdown
- CSS, SCSS, Less

Others coming soon...
